## Symmetric-key encryption (secret key encryption)

* Symmetric-key algorithms are cryptographic algorithms that employ the same cryptographic keys both for plaintext encryption and ciphertext decoding.

* The keys could be identical, or there could be a simple transition between them


## Asymmetric-key encryption (public key encryption)

* Asymmetric-key algorithms encrypt and decrypt a message using a pair of related keys (one public key and one private key) and safeguard it from unauthorized access or usage.
