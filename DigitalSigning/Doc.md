# Digital Signature Algorithms

* Eliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA): is a more highly complicated public-key cryptography encryption algorithm. Elliptic curve cryptography is a type of public key cryptography that uses the algebraic structure of elliptic curves with finite fields as its foundation. Elliptic curve cryptography is primarily used to generate pseudo-random numbers, digital signatures, and other data.

* Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA): The Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) was proposed as a replacement for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm for performing fast public-key digital signatures (ECDSA). Its primary benefits for embedded devices are higher performance and simple, secure implementations. During a signature, no branch or lookup operations based on the secret values are performed. Many side-channel attacks are foiled by these properties.
