### Overview of ECDH

* It it a key agreement algorithm. 

* Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is a key agreement protocol that enables two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel, each with an elliptic-curve public-private key pair. This shared secret can be used directly as a key or to generate another key. Following that, the key, or the derived key, can be used to encrypt subsequent communications with a symmetric-key cipher.
