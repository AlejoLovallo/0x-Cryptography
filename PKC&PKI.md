### A bit of history

* Early public-key systems based their security on the assumption that it is difficult to factor a large integer composed of two or more large prime factors.

* For later elliptic-curve-based protocols, the base assumption is that finding the discrete logarithm of a random elliptic curve element with respect to a publicly known base point is infeasible: this is the **"elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem" (ECDLP)**. 

* The security of elliptic curve cryptography depends on the ability to compute a point multiplication and the inability to compute the multiplicand given the original and product points. The size of the elliptic curve, measured by the total number of discrete integer pairs satisfying the curve equation, determines the difficulty of the problem.
