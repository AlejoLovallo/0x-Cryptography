### What is an ECDSA?

* An Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) uses ECC keys to ensure each user is unique and every transaction is secure. Although this kind of digital signing algorithm (DSA) offers a functionally indistinguishable outcome as other DSAs, it uses the smaller keys youâ€™d expect from ECC and therefore is more efficient.

*  Both Bitcoin and Ethereum apply the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) specifically in signing transactions.
